This repository contains various tasks, each organized into its own branch. Below is a list of the tasks and their respective branches:

## Branches and Tasks:

- **Task 1:** Heroic Problem-Solving Day Using C++

  - This task includes five problem-solving questions designed to test your skills in C++ programming. The difficulty increases gradually, allowing you to apply basic programming concepts and algorithmic thinking to solve each problem.
  - The problems cover topics such as greeting Justice League members, building pyramids in Atlantis, searching through arrays, tracking flight heights with Superman, and battle planning with Batman.

- **Task 2:** Heroic Hardware Challenges

  - This task involves three hardware-related challenges:
    - **Bat-Signal Upgrade:** Design a circuit to upgrade the Bat-Signal, including converting 220V AC to 5V DC and controlling an LED.
    - **Atlantis Gate Control:** Design an H-bridge driver to control the direction of a DC motor for opening and closing gates in Atlantis.
    - **Cyborgâ€™s Battery Selection:** Identify the most suitable battery configuration to power Cyborg's enhancements, balancing cost, performance, weight, and size.

- **Task 3:** Gotham's Minefield

  - This task involves both hardware and software challenges:
    - **Mine Detection:** Equip the bot with a photoresistor to detect mines and trigger a buzzer.
    - **Mine Defusal:** Use a servo motor to safely defuse detected mines.
    - **Navigation:** Program the bot to move and rotate to navigate Gotham's streets.
    - **Obstacle Avoidance:** Implement ultrasonic sensors to avoid obstacles.
    - **Integration:** Combine all components to ensure smooth operation in detecting, defusing, and navigating.

- **Task 4:** Overcoming Tempest

  - This task contains various challenges involving weather analysis, strategic battle simulation, and machine learning predictions are tackled to aid Batman and the Justice League.
    - **Weather Analysis:** Load, clean, and visualize weather data.
    - **Battle Planning:** Implement a chess game to simulate strategies.
    - **Weather Prediction:** Develop a machine learning model to forecast weather.

- **Task 5:** Communicate
  - This task focuses on setting up secure communication networks and converting analog signals to digital form.
    - **Arkham Asylum Secure Communication:** Implement a secure communication system using Arduino, with a master-slave configuration over I2C and serial communication.
    - **Digital World:** Design and implement a system to convert analog signals to digital using ADC with varying sampling times and encoders.
- **Task 6:** Heroic PCB

  - This task focuses on designing an H-bridge circuit for controlling the Batmobile's motor to enhance its agility and speed.
    - **H-Bridge Circuit Design:** Design and implement an H-bridge circuit in Altium to control the direction and speed of a 12V, 3A DC motor.
    - **Safety Features:** Incorporate safety considerations, such as flyback diodes, to protect the circuit and motor.

- **Task 7:** Smart Heroic Tools
  - This task requires uploading all your completed tasks to the Justice League's central GitHub repository.
    - **Hackers!:** Practice Linux commands, document in Markdown, and upload to the branch.
